Add some PHP files to the `.\lot\route` folder. Each file in this folder serves as an executable function for the
routes:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── route\
        ├── user\
        │   └── create.php
        ├── contact.php
        └── user.php
~~~

A route file contains a function to be executed by the `route` hook. It provides several arguments that you can use in
the function. You can also return a value to be received by the next hook (if any) at the end of the function.

~~~ .php
<?php

return function ($content, $path, $query, $hash) {
    // Do something here…
};
~~~

The function will be executed when the current URL path points to an existing route file without the `.php` extension.
Based on the file structure above, you should have this list of active routes which can be visited publicly:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/contact
http://127.0.0.1/user
http://127.0.0.1/user/create
~~~

Routes that are more specific will be executed after routes that are more general (their parent routes). It means that
route file `.\lot\route\user.php` will be executed before route file `.\lot\route\user\create.php` when you visit
`http://127.0.0.1/user/create`. The value returned by the route function from file `.\lot\route\user.php` will be passed
to the first function argument of the route function in file `.\lot\route\user\create.php`.

~~~ .php
// From `.\lot\route\user.php`
return function ($content, $path, $query, $hash) {
    // The value of variable `$path` will be `'/user'` when you visit `http://127.0.0.1/user`
    // The value of variable `$path` will be `'/user/create'` when you visit `http://127.0.0.1/user/create`
    // You actually don’t have to create file `.\lot\route\user\create.php`. You can have your own way to process the path after `'/user'`
    if ('/user/create' === $path) {
        // Do something here…
    } else if (0 === strpos($path, '/user/delete/')) {
        $name = basename($path);
        // Do something with `$name` here…
    } else if (0 === strpos($path, '/user/read/')) {
        $name = basename($path);
        // Do something with `$name` here…
    } else if (0 === strpos($path, '/user/update/')) {
        $name = basename($path);
        // Do something with `$name` here…
    } else {
        // Do something else here…
    }
    // This value will be passed to the child routes
    return 123;
};
~~~

~~~ .php
// From `.\lot\route\user\create.php`
return function ($content, $path, $query, $hash) {
    // The value of variable `$content` will be `123`
    // The value of variable `$path` will be `'/user/create'`
}

Below is a route definition example to read a specific page file stored in a custom folder which you can see the result
by visiting `http://127.0.0.1/a-static-page`:

~~~ .php
// From `.\lot\route\a-static-page.php`
// We can omit the arguments here because they are not needed in the function body
return function () {
    // Set some page conditionals which will also effect the `<html>` classes
    State::set([
        'has' => [
            'next' => false,
            'page' => true,
            'pages' => false,
            'part' => false,
            'prev' => false
        ],
        'is' => [
            'error' => false,
            'page' => true,
            'pages' => false
        ]
    ]);
    // Store current page to variable `$page` globally so that it can be shared to the layout
    $GLOBALS['page'] = $page = new Page('.\path\to\a-static-page.page');
    // Append page title to the current window title
    $GLOBALS['t'][] = $page->title;
    // Return a response for layout, so it will load `.\lot\y\*\page.php` file in the end
    return ['page', [], 200];
};
